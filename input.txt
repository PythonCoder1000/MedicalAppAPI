IMPRESSION
1. No focal disc protrusions or extrusions identified.
2. T2-3, T3-4, T11-12 and T12-L1 levels show 2 mm posterior annular bulges and crowding
of the ventral cord, mild canal stenosis AP dimension 9-10 mm, mild foraminal compromise.
No cord compression or nerve root impingement detected.
3. Visualized portions of the abdomen suggest enlargement and fatty infiltration of the liver
with 5 mm rounded high T2 signal intensity possibly cystic structure posterior segment right
lobe. Correlation with abdominal ultrasound is suggested for further evaluation.
